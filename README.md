# Spam-Mail-Detection

This project focuses on the detection of spam and ham (non-spam) emails using a machine learning logistic regression model. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.

## Overview

Emails are a common means of communication, and distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails is crucial. This project uses a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or ham based on certain features.

## Model

The machine learning model is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python, with logistic regression as the chosen algorithm. The Jupyter Notebook is designed to guide you through the process of training, evaluating, and using the model for email classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrnithish/Spam-Mail-Detection.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Spam_Mail_Detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and train the model.
4. Use the trained model to classify new emails as spam or ham.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is available in the `dataset` folder. It includes labeled examples of spam and ham emails.
